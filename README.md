# Modifications
* Installed [scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) (use `shift + pageup` `shift + pagedown` or `shift + scrollwheel` to scroll up and down in the terminal).
* Installed [solarized](https://st.suckless.org/patches/solarized/) (the patch includes both light and dark solarized themes, the default key to switch between them is F6).
* Changed the default font size to something more readable.
* Remaped `ctrl + +` and `ctrl + -` to increase and decrease font size respectively.
